# ðŸ§  Student Performance Prediction with PySpark

This project predicts student exam performance using **Apache Spark** for building efficient and scalable machine learning models. By leveraging distributed computing, the goal is to enhance processing efficiency while analyzing the factors influencing student success, such as study habits, attendance, and parental involvement.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

Educational institutions often face challenges in identifying factors affecting student performance. This project aims to:
1. Predict whether a student will **pass or fail** an exam based on various features.
2. Demonstrate the efficiency of distributed computing with **Apache Spark**.
3. Compare performance using:
   - **Single-worker setup** (one VM as a worker).
   - **Distributed setup** (two VMs: one master and one worker).

Using the **Student Performance Factors Dataset** from Kaggle, this study highlights the computational advantages of Spark and provides insights into critical factors affecting student outcomes.
